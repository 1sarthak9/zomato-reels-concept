# zomato-reels-concept
Reels-based food discovery concept for Zomato, focusing on backend APIs, product logic, and edge cases like video ownership and deletion.
Zomato Reels is a concept project exploring a short-video (Reels-style) discovery layer for food ordering platforms like Zomato.

The goal is to reduce the gap between expected vs actual food quality by allowing short customer videos to live at the restaurant level, helping users make better ordering decisions.

This project focuses more on product thinking, backend API flows, and real-world edge cases rather than rebuilding the entire Zomato application.
